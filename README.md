# SingleCell_Analysis - Comparing the cell heterogenity of the arabidopsis root heat and sucrose treatments 

## Processed scRNA-seq data from Arabidopsis under heat and sucrose treatments.
* Implemented the Seurat analytical pipeline to perform dimensionality
reduction, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis.
* Identified distinct clusters associated with the heat response, comparing
them to control and sucrose-treated samples.
* Characterized the gene expression patterns within the unique heat
response cluster.
