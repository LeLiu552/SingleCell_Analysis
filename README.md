# SingleCell_Analysis - Comparing the cellular heterogenity of the arabidopsis roots under heat and sucrose treatments 

## Processed scRNA-seq data from Arabidopsis under heat and sucrose treatments.
* Implemented the Seurat analytical pipeline to perform dimensionality
reduction, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis.
* Identified distinct clusters associated with the heat response, comparing
them to control and sucrose-treated samples.
* Characterized the gene expression patterns and functional enrichment within the unique heat
response cluster.
* Trajectory analysis revealed the origin of heat shock cluster.
